Angular was designed by Google to address challenges programmers face building complex, single-page applications. This JavaScript platform provides a solid core of web functionality, letting you take care of the design and implementation details.

In this project, I have exploit the essentials of this "superheroic" platform, including powerful features such as two-way data binding, comprehensive routing, and dependency injection. I have build a full-featured web app displaying blog from start to finish adding one feature at a time to the platform, focusing on the component-based architecture of Angular. You can add new blog or remove existing. Also you can filter blogs as per its genre. Other angular features exploitated includes:

- Binding events and properties
- Getting data to components
- Using directives and pipes
- Creating Angular forms
- Validating form data
- How Angular does dependency injection
- Making HTTP calls
- Routing
- Styling components

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have these installed

- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [git](http://git-scm.com/)

2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC)

   `git clone https://github.com/zkabari1/AngularProject.git`

3. CD to the folder

   `cd AngularProject`

   and then fetch all of the remote branches for the repository

   `git fetch --all`

4. Run the following to install the project dependencies:

   `npm install`

5. Run the ng serve command to build the code, watch for file changes, and serve up the site locally:

   `ng serve`

6. Navigate to http://localhost:4200. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

   `http://localhost:4200/`

The repository has a branch for each new feature added. You can checkout branches using `git checkout <branchname>` and not have to re-run `npm install` each time since you will remain in the same root folder.
